## Guides

Amplify guides are meant to give you a more in-depth understanding of how to use the Amplify UI components and theming to build out common functionality, end-to-end solutions, and frequently asked for workflows.

## Overview

Guides are organized by topic, but some guides may overlap multiple topics (i.e. Authentication & Theming) to demonstrate how to integrate multiple services together.

Guides may combine the CLI and libraries together in a single tutorial. This is done to provide an end-to-end solution using both the service creation and configuration as well as connecting to and interacting with the service from a client-side application.

export default ({ children }) => (
  <MyLayoutTest children={children}></MyLayoutTest>
);
